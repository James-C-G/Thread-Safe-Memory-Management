## General
An investigation into differnt thread-safe memory management algorithms, with imeplementations at different iterations of the same algorithm. The program is written in C for a university coursework, and aims to investigate the C language commands:

```
malloc
calloc
free
```

## Languages Used
* C

## Features
* Test harness for each stage
* Thread-safe memory management
* Multiple algorithms for memory management
* Linked-list data structure for memory management system

## Usage
For usage simple see the test C files for how to run the different aspects of the algorithm. From there simply run:

```
int main();
```

   
## Status
Version 1.4
